# Welcome to the Camping Searcher!

This is my first legitimate deployment of a Node.js website on Heroku. This is a website for camping and outdoors enthusiasts to share places they love to camp, hike, etc. from around the globe. It is a full fledged website (although not having all the capabilities necessarily of some sites these days. But hey, I'm just getting better every day!) with sign up, login/logout, authorization/authentication, password changing as well as CRUD functions with posts/comments. It's built using EJS, JS, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and MongoDB (Atlas for deployed server).  Feel free to check out the site by going to https://campingsearcher.herokuapp.com/  or just click [here](https://campingsearcher.herokuapp.com/).
